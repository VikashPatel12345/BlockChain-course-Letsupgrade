1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?

Ans.The Blockchain technology that holds chain of transactional records by ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization. Each block contains a cryptographic data of previous data. It is also a distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

2. What is the core problem Blockchain trying to solve?
core problems:
1. Security
2. Decentralization.
3. Authentication.
some other problems can be solved:
1. Real Estate
2. Crowdfunding
3. Intellectual Property
4. Voting System
5. Currency and Transaction Support

3. What are the few features which Blockchain will give u?

1. Verifiable
2. Unchangeable
3. Tamper proof
4. Immutable
5. Decentralized

4. What all things does a Block Contain?
1. Block number.
2. Records.
3. Previous block signature.
4. Current Block signature
5. Mining Key

5. How is the verifiability of Blockchain is been attained ?
The Blockchain can be verifiability by the data or the key which are stored in the distributed systems.
formula:-
Current Block Signature = Previous Block Signature + Data in the Block
ex: BlockData = Fingerprint1
NewData1 + previous fingerprint1 = Fingerprint2
NewData2 + previous fingerprint2 = Fingerprint3 and
so on...........
